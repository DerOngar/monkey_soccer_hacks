Hacks for Monkey Soccer, the mini game in Ape Escape 2 on the PS2
## Unlock the last 3 monkeys
A way to finally choose the last 3 monkeys (Tommy, Yoshi, Goku) in any version of the game.
### Explanation
The last 3 monkeys (Tommy, Yoshi and Goku) are permanently locked in any non japanese versions of Ape Escape 2 even if you catch them in the main game.

In the japanese version you have to use a seperate disc called the Ukki Ukki Disc to make them appear in the main game instead of beating Specter like in the non japanese versions. The Ukki Ukki Disc alters your Ape Escape 2 save which makes them appear in the main game and if you catch them they are available in Monkey Soccer as well.

This cheat adds the alteration made by the Ukki Ukki Disc to any version of the game which makes the last 3 monkeys selectable in Monkey Soccer.

### Instructions
1. Download the correct .pnach file depending on the version of the game you have
2. Put it in PCSX2\cheats
3. In PCSX2 right-click the game, choose "Properties..."
4. In the Cheats tab check "Enable Cheats" and choose "Unlock last 3 Monkeys" and any other cheats that you want to activate
